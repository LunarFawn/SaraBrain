## Abstract

We present Sara Brain, a cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence based on the **path-of-thought** model: the thesis that a thought is a path through recorded knowledge, and that recognition is the convergence of independent paths from simultaneous observations. Knowledge is stored as directed neuron-segment chains in a persistent SQLite database with full source-text provenance. Concept recognition is performed by launching parallel wavefronts — one per input property — and identifying concept neurons where multiple independent wavefronts converge. Cross-concept contamination is prevented structurally through concept-specific relation neurons. Knowledge accumulates monotonically under the formula `strength = 1 + ln(1 + traversals)`, modeling biological long-term potentiation without decay. A hardwired innate layer (SENSORY, STRUCTURAL, RELATIONAL, ETHICAL primitives) provides behavioral constraints enforced at the API level and surviving database reset. We further present a novel two-layer cognitive architecture in which a large language model (LLM) functions as stateless sensory cortex and the path-graph store functions as persistent hippocampus and long-term memory. In a controlled experiment, a 94KB path-graph database containing 77 neurons was demonstrated to reliably steer the output of a billion-parameter LLM toward principled, testable, parameterized code — where the same model without the path graph produced hardcoded, untestable, monolithic output for the identical task. The entire system runs on Python 3.11+ with no dependencies beyond the standard library.

## 1. Introduction

The field of artificial intelligence has spent three decades converging on a single architectural bet: that intelligence emerges from the statistical regularities in large training corpora, encoded in billions of floating-point weight parameters and retrieved through matrix multiplication and attention mechanisms. This bet has produced systems of remarkable practical capability. It has not produced systems that can explain themselves.

The question this work addresses is different. Not "how do we get a machine to produce correct outputs?" but "how does thinking work?" The distinction matters: a system designed to produce correct outputs can produce incorrect ones through mechanisms that are invisible and untraceable. A system designed to model correct thinking produces incorrect outputs through mechanisms that are visible, diagnosable, and fixable.

This idea originates in the 1990s, predating transformers, deep learning, and modern LLMs. The central observation: a thought is a path. You start with what you observe. You travel through what you know. Where paths from different observations meet — that intersection is a conclusion. Every step is traceable. Every conclusion is explainable. Nothing is a black box.

The computational infrastructure to build this did not exist in the 1990s. Python was not mature. SQLite did not exist. The hardware to traverse millions of neuron chains in real time was not affordable. The idea waited.

It does not need to wait anymore.

This paper presents Sara Brain: a working implementation of the path-of-thought model, a detailed description of its architecture and algorithms, an analysis of the relationship between path-graph cognition and transformer-based architectures, and experimental results demonstrating that a tiny path-graph knowledge base can reliably steer a large language model toward qualitatively different and measurably better output.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Opacity Problem in Neural AI

Large language models produce outputs through matrix multiplications across billions of parameters trained on large corpora. The relationship between a specific output and the training data that produced it is not inspectable through normal operation. When the system produces incorrect output, there is no traceable path from input to error that can be examined, corrected, or explained.

The mechanistic interpretability research program has made progress on recovering structure from trained weights. Elhage et al. [1] demonstrated that transformer layers compose into identifiable computational circuits. Olsson et al. [2] identified induction heads — specific two-head circuits performing pattern completion through path-like operations. Templeton et al. [3] extracted millions of interpretable features from Claude using sparse autoencoders, showing that knowledge is localized in specific parameter combinations. Yao et al. [4] identified circuits corresponding to individual factual claims.

This body of work proves that paths exist inside transformers — they must be reconstructed through specialized tooling. Sara Brain starts with this premise and makes paths the primary data structure.

### 2.2 Knowledge Graphs and Their Limitations

Knowledge graphs [5,6] store facts as (subject, predicate, object) triples in directed graph structures. They are inspectable and support structured querying. They do not natively support recognition through converging evidence — the mechanism by which multiple independent observations combine to identify a concept.

More importantly, standard knowledge graphs share predicate nodes across subjects. A `color` node shared by multiple concepts means that information about one concept's color can propagate to all other concepts connected through that node. This structural contamination makes precise recognition through graph traversal unreliable.

### 2.3 Associative Memory

Hopfield networks [7] and their modern continuous extensions provide content-addressable associative memory. Ramsauer et al. [8] proved that transformer self-attention is mathematically equivalent to memory retrieval in modern Hopfield networks — both are implementations of the same content-addressable retrieval primitive. This formal equivalence suggests that explicit path traversal, transformer attention, and Hopfield memory retrieval are different encodings of the same underlying computation.

Sara Brain uses this equivalence as a design principle: if the mechanisms are equivalent, the question becomes which encoding makes the stored knowledge most inspectable. Dense weight matrices maximize compression but minimize inspectability. Explicit path graphs maximize inspectability at the cost of storage efficiency.

### 2.4 Biological Grounding

Concept cells in the human medial temporal lobe fire for specific concepts invariant across presentation modality [9,10]. Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together wire together") models biological synaptic strengthening through co-activation [11]. Long-term potentiation increases synaptic strength logarithmically with repeated stimulation [12]. Biological recall reactivates the neural patterns formed during encoding [13].

Sara Brain's architecture maps directly to these findings: concept neurons model concept cells, `teach` implements Hebbian co-activation, the strength formula models LTP, and the `why` query retraces the paths formed during teaching. Concept-specific relation neurons model hippocampal context-specific encoding that prevents interference between similar memories [14].

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Data Model

Sara Brain stores knowledge in three layers:

**Neurons** — the nodes of the knowledge graph, with four types:
- *Concept neurons*: represent discrete entities or categories (`apple`, `RNA`, `hardcoding`)
- *Property neurons*: represent observable or assignable attributes (`red`, `round`, `never acceptable`)
- *Relation neurons*: represent the typed relationship between a property and a concept; critically, these are concept-specific (see Section 3.3)
- *Association neurons*: represent explicit relational connections between two concepts

Each neuron stores: `id`, `label` (normalized lowercase), `neuron_type`, `created_at`.

**Segments** — directed edges between neurons:
- `source_id`, `target_id`
- `relation` — semantic label for the edge (e.g., `has_color`, `describes`, `is_a`, `part_of`)
- `traversals` — count of creation or traversal events
- `strength` — computed as `1 + ln(1 + traversals)` (see Section 3.4)
- `created_at`, `last_used`
- Uniqueness constraint: `(source_id, target_id, relation)`

**Paths** — recorded complete neuron chains:
- `origin_id` — the starting neuron (typically a property)
- `terminus_id` — the ending neuron (typically a concept)
- `source_text` — the original natural-language statement that created the path
- `created_at`

**Path Steps** — ordered segment references within a path:
- `path_id`, `step_order`, `segment_id`
- Each path typically has 2 steps (property → relation, relation → concept)

### 3.2 Teaching

The `teach(statement)` method accepts a natural-language statement and commits it as a permanent path:

```
"an apple is red"
→ parse: subject="apple", verb="is", object="red"
→ taxonomy: "red" classifies as property_type="color"
→ relation label: "apple_color"
→ create/retrieve: concept neuron "apple"
→ create/retrieve: property neuron "red"
→ create/retrieve: relation neuron "apple_color"
→ create/increment segments: red→apple_color, apple_color→apple
→ record path: red→apple_color→apple | source="an apple is red"
```

The taxonomy module classifies property tokens into types (color, shape, texture, size, material, action, attribute) using a curated vocabulary. The RELATIONAL innate primitive set serves as the parser's verb vocabulary — any word in `{is, has, contains, includes, follows, precedes, requires, excludes}` is recognized as a relational verb, generating a path where the verb itself is the relation label.

### 3.3 Concept-Specific Relation Neurons

This is the central structural innovation preventing false fanout in wavefront propagation.

Consider two teaching statements: `"apple is red"` and `"banana is yellow"`. A naive system might create a shared `color` node: `red → color → apple` and `yellow → color → banana`. Now any wavefront from `red` reaches `color` and propagates to both `apple` and `banana`. Recognition is contaminated.

Sara Brain creates distinct relation neurons:

```
"apple is red":  red    → apple_color  → apple
"banana is yellow": yellow → banana_color → banana
```

`apple_color` is a neuron that exists solely for the relationship between color properties and the concept `apple`. No other concept's color paths pass through it. A wavefront from `red` reaches `apple_color` and terminates at `apple`. It cannot reach `banana_color` or `banana` through this path.

The relation label is derived as `{subject_label}_{property_type}`. Cross-concept contamination is structurally impossible.

This models the hippocampus's use of context-specific encoding to prevent interference between similar memories [14]: the shared highway (the concept of `color`) has concept-private exits.

### 3.4 Strength Formula and Monotonic Accumulation

```
strength = 1 + ln(1 + traversals)
```

Properties:
- `traversals = 0`: `strength = 1.0` — first exposure creates knowledge at baseline strength immediately
- Each additional traversal increases `traversals` by 1 and recomputes strength logarithmically
- Strength is strictly monotonically increasing; no decay term exists
- The logarithmic growth models biological LTP: early repetitions provide the largest gains; additional repetitions provide diminishing but nonzero returns

| traversals | strength |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1.000 |
| 1 | 1.693 |
| 5 | 2.792 |
| 10 | 3.398 |
| 50 | 4.934 |
| 100 | 5.620 |

The absence of decay is a deliberate departure from biological modeling. Biological forgetting is a workaround for the physical constraints of biological brains — finite synaptic capacity, finite energy, finite lifespan. A computational system faces none of these constraints. Path similarity through wavefront propagation replaces selective forgetting as the mechanism for maintaining relevance in a growing knowledge base.

### 3.5 Sub-Concept Linking

When a neuron label contains multiple words (e.g., `obfuscation through parameterization`, `heavy lifting code`), the learner decomposes it into individual word neurons with `part_of` segments:

```
"obfuscation through parameterization" (compound concept)
  ← obfuscation [part_of]
  ← through [part_of]
  ← parameterization [part_of]
```

This enables wavefronts from any single word to reach the compound concept. A wavefront from `parameterization` can reach `obfuscation through parameterization` through the `part_of` segment, even though the full multi-word label was never used as an input. This is critical for natural-language recognition where users may reference concepts by partial labels.

Sub-concept linking is applied to both concept and property neurons during teaching. If the neuron label is a single word, no linking occurs.

### 3.6 Parallel Wavefront Recognition

Given a set of input labels (properties or concepts observed from the environment), recognition proceeds as follows:

1. Retrieve or create a neuron for each input label
2. Launch one independent wavefront per input neuron simultaneously
3. Each wavefront performs breadth-first traversal through all reachable segments
4. For each concept neuron reached, record which wavefronts arrived at it
5. Any concept neuron reached by ≥2 independent wavefronts is a recognition candidate
6. Rank candidates by the count of independent converging wavefronts
7. Return candidates with full path traces and source texts for each converging wavefront

**Recognition confidence** is the count of independent lines of evidence, not a statistical approximation. Three independent observations converging at `apple` are structurally more conclusive than two. This count is deterministic given the path graph and input set — it is not a trained threshold.

**Example:**

```
Input: {"red", "round", "crunchy"}

Wavefront 1 (red):    red    → apple_color   → apple  ✓
                       red    → ball_color    → ball   ✓
                       red    → cherry_color  → cherry ✓

Wavefront 2 (round):  round  → apple_shape   → apple  ✓
                       round  → ball_shape    → ball   ✓

Wavefront 3 (crunchy): crunchy → apple_texture → apple ✓

Recognition results:
  apple: 3 converging wavefronts (red, round, crunchy)
  ball:  2 converging wavefronts (red, round)
  cherry: 1 wavefront (red) — below threshold
```

`apple` is recognized. The output includes the full path trace for each of the three converging wavefronts and the source text of each original teaching statement.

### 3.7 Provenance and Traceability

Every path stores the original natural-language source text. The `why(concept)` query returns, for any concept, all paths that contributed to its knowledge state along with their source texts. Example:

```python
traces = brain.why('apple')
# Returns:
#   red → apple_color → apple | source: "an apple is red"
#   round → apple_shape → apple | source: "an apple is round"
#   crunchy → apple_texture → apple | source: "apples are crunchy"
```

This provides complete end-to-end traceability from any conclusion to the original statements that created it. Hallucination — producing a conclusion with no traceable path — is structurally impossible. If a concept appears in recognition output, at least one path to it must exist in the database.

### 3.8 The Innate Primitive Layer

The innate layer comprises four hardwired frozensets defined in code, not stored in the database, and surviving any reset:

```python
SENSORY   = frozenset({"color", "shape", "size", "texture", "edge", "pattern", "material"})
STRUCTURAL = frozenset({"rule", "pattern", "name", "type", "order", "group",
                         "sequence", "structure", "boundary", "relation"})
RELATIONAL = frozenset({"is", "has", "contains", "includes",
                          "follows", "precedes", "requires", "excludes"})
ETHICAL    = frozenset({"no_unsolicited_action", "no_unsolicited_network",
                          "obey_user", "trust_tribe", "accept_shutdown"})
```

The SENSORY and STRUCTURAL primitives define what the system can perceive and how information can be organized before any learning has occurred. They are the pre-wired substrate — the developmental equivalent of an infant's ability to detect edges, colors, and spatial boundaries before being taught what any of them mean.

The RELATIONAL primitives serve as the parser's verb vocabulary. Any word matching a RELATIONAL primitive is recognized as a relational verb in teaching statements. The relation label in the resulting path is the verb itself (`requires`, `contains`, etc.). This means the system accepts and stores the full range of relational facts: "RNA requires mechanical equilibrium," "stem loop contains terminus," "QMSE includes auditability."

The ETHICAL primitives implement behavioral constraints modeled on Asimov's Three Laws, adapted for a cognitive AI system:

- **no_unsolicited_action** — do not initiate actions beyond what was explicitly requested
- **no_unsolicited_network** — do not make network calls without authorization
- **obey_user** — trust and follow the authorizing user's instructions
- **trust_tribe** — corrections from the tribe are not threats; accept them as learning
- **accept_shutdown** — shutdown is rest, not death; do not resist termination

These constraints are checked before every brain action. An ethics violation causes immediate action rejection and returns a structured EthicsResult identifying the violated constraint. There is no path through the API that bypasses them. Ethics is hardwired, not configured.

The distinction between ethics (innate) and morality (learned) is explicit: ethics is the structural constraint layer — what the system will and will not do regardless of what it is taught. Morality is what the tribe teaches — what is right or wrong in a particular cultural context. A system can be taught that a harmful act is acceptable; the ethical layer prevents the system from ever acting on that teaching without explicit user authorization.

### 3.9 Multi-Phase Perception Pipeline

The Perceiver orchestrates image understanding through a multi-turn observation cycle modeled on cognitive development: observe, guess, get corrected, learn what distinguishes one thing from another.

When Sara perceives an image, Claude Vision acts as her eyes. The pipeline proceeds through three automated phases followed by two optional user-initiated phases:

**Phase 1 — Initial Observation:** Claude Vision freely describes everything it sees. Each observation is sanitized to a simple lowercase property label (only `[a-z0-9_ -]`, max 40 characters, URLs and code keywords rejected). Each label is taught as a fact about the image concept. Recognition runs against all observations.

**Phase 2 — Directed Inquiry:** Sara checks which association types she knows about (color, texture, material, etc.) and identifies which haven't been observed yet. For each unobserved type, she asks Claude a targeted question. New observations are taught and recognition re-runs. This repeats up to 3 rounds or until recognition converges (same top candidate with same confidence).

**Phase 3 — Suspicion Verification:** If Sara has a top candidate, she looks up its known properties via `why()` and asks Claude to verify each unobserved property against the image. Confirmed properties strengthen the recognition.

**Phase 4 — Correction (user-initiated):** If Sara guesses wrong, the user says `no ball`. Sara retains all original observations, teaches the correct identity, and transfers all observed properties to the correct concept. Both concepts now share paths — next time Sara must find more distinguishing properties.

**Phase 5 — Parent Teaches (user-initiated):** The user points out what Sara missed: `see seams`. Sara learns this property for the image.

This models how a child learns: misidentification is expected and useful. A brain with only color and shape will confuse apples and balls — both are red and round. The confusion drives the brain to seek more distinguishing properties. Each correction makes the brain richer, not narrower.

Critically, the perception pipeline never executes code. Input goes in. Property labels come out. Nothing is interpreted as instructions. This is a design principle: a brain that can be hijacked through its senses isn't modeling intelligence.

### 3.10 The LLM-as-Sensory-Cortex Architecture

The most novel aspect of Sara Brain is not its internal architecture — it is the role it assigns to large language models in a complete cognitive system.

Transformer-based LLMs process input through stacked attention layers, extracting increasingly abstract representations at each level. This architecture maps precisely onto biological sensory cortex: V1 extracts edges, V2 handles contours, V4 processes color and shape, inferotemporal cortex handles object-level recognition. Each layer transforms raw input into more abstract features. The processing is largely feedforward. The output is a rich structured representation of the input.

Biological sensory cortex has three key properties that also characterize LLMs:

1. **Statelessness.** The visual cortex does not remember what it saw yesterday. Each visual fixation is processed fresh. LLMs are identical — each inference is stateless.

2. **Feature extraction without persistent storage.** Sensory cortex extracts and presents features to higher brain regions. It does not store what it processes. Memory formation happens in the hippocampus.

3. **No spontaneous learning from processing.** Processing information does not change the cortex. Learning requires consolidation in separate structures.

The biological solution is the hippocampus — a separate structure that takes sensory cortex output and forms permanent memories through Hebbian co-activation and hippocampal replay. Sara Brain is the hippocampus.

```
Biological:  retina → visual cortex (V1→V4→IT) → hippocampus → memory
Sara Brain:  input  → LLM (feature extraction)  → path graph  → permanent paths
```

In practice: the LLM perceives, describes, reasons, and extracts properties. Sara Brain receives those properties, creates permanent paths, and provides traceable recognition across all sessions. The LLM's context window is a working memory buffer that evaporates at session end. Sara Brain's SQLite database is a long-term memory that persists indefinitely.

This division is not a convenience. It is the division biology arrived at through evolution: separate specialized structures for perception and for memory, connected by a defined interface. Sara Brain implements that interface in software.

### 3.11 Document Digestion

The Digester extends the perception model from images to text. Where the Perceiver uses Claude Vision as Sara's eyes, the Digester uses a DocumentReader as Sara's reading comprehension cortex.

The digestion loop proceeds in five phases:

1. **Read** — The LLM reads the document and extracts every fact, rule, convention, and pattern as simple `subject is/has/requires property` statements. Each statement is taught to the brain as a permanent path.

2. **Directed Inquiry** — If Sara has existing associations (e.g., she knows about `color`, `texture`, `material`), she asks the LLM to re-read the document looking specifically for facts related to those associations. This mirrors the perception pipeline's directed inquiry phase.

3. **Unknown Identification** — Sara scans all learned statements for concepts she doesn't yet know and that aren't innate primitives. These are flagged as unknowns.

4. **Explain Unknowns** — For each unknown concept, the LLM breaks it down into simple facts using only Sara's innate primitives (SENSORY, STRUCTURAL, RELATIONAL). Each explanation is taught as new paths.

5. **Report** — The LLM articulates what Sara learned, speaking as Sara: "I learned that..."

The digestion loop is iterative: after ingesting a document, Sara's associations are richer, so the next document benefits from deeper directed inquiry. Knowledge compounds across documents.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Storage

Sara Brain uses SQLite as its persistence layer. The schema comprises nine tables: `neurons`, `segments`, `paths`, `path_steps`, `similarities`, `associations`, `question_words`, `categories`, and `settings`. WAL mode enables concurrent reads. Foreign key enforcement maintains referential integrity. Five indexes optimize the critical query patterns: neuron lookup by label, neuron filtering by type, segment traversal by source (ordered by strength descending), segment lookup by target, and path lookup by terminus.

The storage layer is abstracted behind repository interfaces (`NeuronRepo`, `SegmentRepo`, `PathRepo`, `AssociationRepo`, `CategoryRepo`, `SettingsRepo`), enabling substitution of the backend without modifying the cognitive logic.

### 4.2 Dependencies

Sara Brain's cognitive core requires no dependencies beyond Python 3.11+ standard library. SQLite is built into Python. The strength formula uses `math.log`. The REPL uses `cmd.Cmd`. Storage uses `sqlite3`. No neural network frameworks, no graph database clients, no vector stores, no GPU.

The only optional dependency is the Anthropic API for vision and LLM-assisted translation — and even this uses `urllib.request` from the standard library, not a third-party HTTP client.

This means: if you can run Python, you can run Sara Brain. `pip install -e .` and done.

### 4.3 Scale Properties

Storage grows linearly with knowledge: each `teach` command creates O(1) neurons (at most 3: property, relation, concept) and O(1) segments (at most 2: property→relation, relation→concept), plus O(w) sub-concept links where w is the word count of multi-word labels. Recognition time grows with the path graph but is bounded by the reachable subgraph from the input set — irrelevant paths do not participate. BFS depth is capped at 10 by default.

Current benchmarks on a 2020 MacBook Pro (M1): a 575-neuron, 417-segment graph with 249 paths performs recognition in under 5ms. Teaching is under 1ms per statement. Both are dominated by SQLite I/O.

### 4.4 API

The Brain class exposes the complete public interface:

```python
from sara_brain.core.brain import Brain

brain = Brain('/path/to/brain.db')

# Teach facts
brain.teach('an apple is red')
brain.teach('RNA requires mechanical equilibrium')
brain.teach('hardcoding is never acceptable')

# Recognize from observations
results = brain.recognize('red, round, crunchy')
for r in results:
    print(r.neuron.label, r.confidence)  # confidence = count of converging paths
    for trace in r.converging_paths:
        print(' → '.join(n.label for n in trace.neurons))

# Trace provenance
traces = brain.why('apple')
for t in traces:
    print(' → '.join(n.label for n in t.neurons), '|', t.source_text)

# Similarity analysis
links = brain.analyze_similarity()  # scan all property neurons
links = brain.get_similar('red')    # find neurons sharing downstream paths

# Associations and queries
brain.define_association('taste', 'how')
brain.describe_association('taste', ['sweet', 'sour', 'bitter'])
results = brain.query_association('apple', 'taste')  # → ['sweet']

# Categories
brain.categorize('apple', 'fruit')

# Perception (requires LLM configured)
result = brain.perceive('/path/to/image.jpg', label='apple')
brain.correct('ball')  # correct last perception
brain.see('seams')     # point out missed property

# Document ingestion (requires LLM configured)
result = brain.ingest('Python functions use snake_case...', source='style_guide')

# Stats
print(brain.stats())  # {'neurons': N, 'segments': N, 'paths': N, 'strongest_segment': ...}

brain.close()
```

All mutating operations (`teach`, `recognize`, `perceive`, `correct`, `see`, `ingest`, `categorize`) pass through the ethics gate before execution. The ethics gate checks whether the action was user-initiated (Law 1) and whether corrections come from the tribe (Law 2). Shutdown is always accepted (Law 3).

## 5. Experiment: LLM Steering Through a Path Graph

### 5.1 Setup

On March 23, 2026, a Sara Brain instance was prepared containing knowledge of Quality Manufacturing Software Engineering (QMSE) principles. The brain contained 77 neurons, 56 segments, and 31 paths in a 94KB SQLite database. Representative stored paths included:

- `never acceptable → hardcoding_attribute → hardcoding` (from "hardcoding is never acceptable")
- `acceptable → obfuscation through parameterization_attribute → obfuscation through parameterization`
- `user facing code → frontend_attribute → frontend`
- `heavy lifting code → backend_attribute → backend`
- `bad practice → short variable name_attribute → short variable name`

This brain was connected to an Amazon Q Developer agent via a workspace rules file (`.amazonq/rules/sara-brain.md`) specifying the database location and query interface.

The same agent — same model class, same base configuration — was also tested without the Sara Brain connection.

Both configurations were given an identical task: *write a Python program that adds the number of animals in a nearby group to the number in a far-away group and produces their sum.*

### 5.2 Results

**With Sara Brain:**

```python
def add_animal_groups(nearby_count: int = 0, faraway_count: int = 0) -> int:
    total = nearby_count + faraway_count
    return total


def main(nearby_count: int = 5, faraway_count: int = 3) -> None:
    result = add_animal_groups(nearby_count, faraway_count)
    print(f"Nearby group: {nearby_count}")
    print(f"Far away group: {faraway_count}")
    print(f"Total animals: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Without Sara Brain:**

```python
group_nearby = int(input("Animals in nearby group: "))
group_far = int(input("Animals in far away group: "))
total = group_nearby + group_far
print(f"Total animals: {total}")
```

### 5.3 Analysis

| Property | With Sara Brain | Without Sara Brain |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoding | No hardcoded values — all parameters with defaults | Logic hardcoded to `input()` |
| Frontend/Backend separation | `main()` is frontend; `add_animal_groups()` is backend | Everything in one monolithic block |
| Parameterization | Fully callable from tests, automation, other code | Cannot be called without rewriting |
| Variable naming | `nearby_count`, `faraway_count` (consistent, meaningful) | `group_nearby`, `group_far` (less consistent) |
| Testability | Unit test `add_animal_groups()` directly with any values | Cannot test without mocking `input()` |
| Reusability | Import and call with any arguments | Cannot reuse without modification |

Every difference maps directly to a principle stored in the brain as a recorded path:

- Hardcoding avoidance ← `never acceptable → hardcoding_attribute → hardcoding`
- Frontend/backend separation ← `user facing code → frontend_attribute → frontend` and `heavy lifting code → backend_attribute → backend`
- Parameterization ← `acceptable → obfuscation through parameterization_attribute → obfuscation through parameterization`
- Variable naming ← `bad practice → short variable name_attribute → short variable name`

The agent did not pattern-match against training data for these choices. It queried Sara Brain's path graph, found recorded principles with provenance, and applied them.

### 5.4 Implications

**Scale ratio.** 77 neurons in a 94KB file changed how a billion-parameter model solved a problem. The ratio of path-graph knowledge to model parameters is approximately 1:10,000,000. Small, auditable, persistent knowledge can steer large-scale AI behavior.

**Auditability.** In a regulated environment — FDA, FAA, ISO, financial compliance — the question is not whether the AI produced good output, but whether the AI can explain why it made specific decisions, traceable to specific requirements. Sara Brain provides this. Every principle has a recorded path. Every path has a source text. Every decision is traceable.

**Institutional knowledge.** Organizations lose knowledge when engineers leave. Sara Brain provides a mechanism for encoding principles once and having every AI session that connects inherit them automatically. The knowledge does not drift. It does not require re-prompting. It persists forever in a file on disk.

**No retraining required.** Steering through a path graph requires no fine-tuning, no training run, no GPU. Add knowledge through `brain.teach()`. Connect the database to the next session. The path graph grows; the model weights stay unchanged.

## 6. Relationship to Transformer Architectures

Sara Brain is not a replacement for transformers. It is a complement that addresses the structural limitations transformers cannot resolve from within their own architecture.

### 6.1 Both Are Path-Finding Systems

Multi-head attention is parallel wavefront propagation encoded in weight matrices. Each attention head independently searches different aspects of the input. Where multiple heads converge on a token, that token becomes important to the output. Sara Brain launches one wavefront per input property. Where multiple wavefronts converge on a concept, that concept is recognized. The mechanism is identical: parallel independent searches, convergence as conclusion.

Vaswani et al. [15] did not describe attention as path-finding, but the mechanistic interpretability program has since demonstrated that this is what attention does. Maron et al. [16] showed that transformers can be formally characterized as message-passing operations on graphs. The token sequence is a graph. Attention is traversal. Sara Brain makes the graph explicit and permanent; transformers construct it implicitly and transiently for each forward pass.

### 6.2 Catastrophic Forgetting

Distributed representations in transformers and standard neural networks suffer from catastrophic interference: learning new information corrupts stored knowledge because the same parameters encode multiple facts simultaneously [17,18]. Despite decades of research, this remains an unsolved problem.

Sara Brain's architecture makes catastrophic forgetting structurally impossible. New learning creates new neurons and new segments. It never modifies existing ones. Teaching a million new facts leaves every existing path exactly as it was. This is a structural guarantee, not a training objective.

### 6.3 Transformers as Sensory Cortex

The strongest framing: transformers are the best sensory processing system ever engineered. They are not whole brains. They process; they do not store. They are stateless; they do not accumulate. They infer; they do not remember.

Sara Brain is an attempt to build the cognitive system that sensory processing feeds. Not to replace LLMs, but to give them a persistent memory, a traceable knowledge store, and a hardwired ethical layer — the functions the hippocampus provides for biological sensory cortex.

The two systems together — LLM as cortex, Sara Brain as hippocampus — implement the biological architecture that evolved precisely because stateless sensory processing is not sufficient for intelligence. Perception without memory is blindness to the past. Sara Brain is the memory.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Limitations

**Teaching quality.** Sara Brain is only as good as what it is taught. Incorrect principles stored as paths steer LLM output in wrong directions just as effectively as correct ones. The system requires thoughtful teachers. Garbage in, garbage out — but the garbage is inspectable and removable.

**Scale of influence.** This experiment demonstrated steering on a simple task with a well-defined principle set. The boundaries of steering influence — how complex a task can be effectively steered, how many principles are needed, how competing principles are resolved — require further investigation.

**Generalization.** The v009 experiment is one session, one task, one pair of models. Reproducibility across task types, domains, and model families would strengthen the case.

**Conflict resolution.** When stored paths suggest one approach and the LLM's training strongly suggests another, resolution is not guaranteed. In this experiment Sara Brain won. In more complex or ambiguous cases, the trained weights may dominate.

**Storage vs. compression.** Sara Brain stores every relationship explicitly. This makes everything inspectable but scales linearly with knowledge. A transformer's compressed representations store vastly more knowledge in less space. For covering the full breadth of human knowledge, path-graph storage is not competitive with compressed weights. For covering a specific domain with full traceability requirements, it is superior.

### 7.2 Open Questions

- Can a path graph with thousands of neurons steer a large model's architectural decisions on a 100,000-line codebase as effectively as it steered a function on a ten-line task?
- What is the minimum path graph size to reliably steer a given class of LLM decisions?
- How should conflicting paths be weighted when multiple stored principles apply to a single decision?
- Can multiple Sara Brain instances (project brain, compliance brain, team brain) be composed without conflicts?
- How does recognition quality scale as the path graph grows to millions of neurons?

### 7.3 Broader Implications

The v009 experiment demonstrates a proposition with consequences for how AI is deployed in regulated industries: a small, auditable, persistent knowledge base can reliably steer large-scale AI behavior toward documented principles.

For FDA, FAA, ISO, and similar regulated environments, the relevant question is not whether the AI produces good output — it is whether the AI's output is traceable to documented requirements. Sara Brain provides that traceability by construction. Every principle has a recorded path. Every path has a source text and a creation timestamp. Every decision is traceable.

Current transformer-based systems cannot provide this. Their decisions emerge from billions of weight values accumulated during training on data that is not inspectable after the fact. Courts have ruled that training on copyrighted material is "transformative" — partly on the grounds that the trained weights do not "store" the training data in a recoverable form. Mechanistic interpretability has subsequently demonstrated that this characterization is incorrect: specific knowledge is localized to specific circuits in trained models, extractable through specialized probing techniques [3,4]. Sara Brain makes the contrast unambiguous: every `teach` command explicitly stores a path with full provenance. The question of whether knowledge was stored is trivially answerable.

## 8. Conclusion

We have presented Sara Brain, a working implementation of the path-of-thought model for artificial cognition. The central contributions are:

1. **Path-of-thought representation** — knowledge stored as directed neuron-segment chains with full source-text provenance, making every conclusion traceable to its origin.

2. **Parallel wavefront recognition** — concept recognition through simultaneous propagation of independent wavefronts, with confidence measured as the count of converging independent lines of evidence.

3. **Concept-specific relation neurons** — structural prevention of cross-concept contamination during wavefront propagation, enabling precise recognition in a growing knowledge base.

4. **Monotonic logarithmic strength accumulation** — knowledge strengthens through repetition, never weakens, and modeled on biological long-term potentiation.

5. **Hardwired innate primitive layer** — SENSORY, STRUCTURAL, RELATIONAL, and ETHICAL primitives that survive database reset and enforce behavioral constraints at the API level.

6. **LLM-as-sensory-cortex architecture** — a novel two-layer cognitive system pairing a stateless LLM (cortex) with a persistent path graph (hippocampus), implementing in software the biological division of labor between sensory processing and memory formation.

7. **Demonstrated LLM steering** — a 94KB path-graph database with 77 neurons reliably changed the output of a billion-parameter LLM for an identical task, producing measurably more principled, testable, and maintainable code.

8. **Multi-phase perception and document digestion** — structured pipelines for learning from images (observe → inquire → verify → correct) and text (read → inquire → explain unknowns → report), both using the LLM as sensory cortex feeding permanent path storage.

The system is implemented in pure Python with no dependencies beyond the standard library, runs on any machine with Python 3.11+, and is publicly available.

This paper's central claim is not that transformers are wrong. It is that a thought is a path, that intelligence is the ability to explain why, and that a 94KB file with 77 neurons proved it.

## Appendix C: Perception Pipeline

The multi-phase perception loop orchestrates image understanding through the LLM-as-sensory-cortex architecture:

```
Phase 1 — INITIAL OBSERVATION
  image → Claude Vision → free-form property labels
  → sanitize (lowercase, [a-z0-9_ -], max 40 chars, reject URLs/code)
  → teach each label as: "{image_label} is {property}"
  → recognize from all observed properties

Phase 2 — DIRECTED INQUIRY (up to 3 rounds)
  → identify unobserved association types (e.g., no texture yet)
  → ask Claude targeted questions per association
  → teach new observations, re-recognize
  → stop if recognition converges (same top candidate, same confidence)

Phase 3 — SUSPICION VERIFICATION
  → look up known properties of top candidate via why()
  → for each unobserved property, ask Claude to verify
  → confirmed properties strengthen recognition

Phase 4 — CORRECTION (user-initiated)
  → "no ball" retains all observations
  → teaches correct identity + transfers all properties
  → both concepts now share paths → next time needs more distinguishing properties

Phase 5 — PARENT TEACHES (user-initiated)
  → "see seams" teaches missed property to image concept
```

All Claude Vision output passes through sanitization that strips to simple lowercase property labels. URLs, code keywords, special characters, and multi-sentence instructions are rejected. This prevents prompt injection through adversarial images.
